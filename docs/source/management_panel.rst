Section Box List
****************

Here are all section boxes listed which are inside the current scene.

**List Entry**
 
 Represents one section box inside the current scene, giving you access to the following features.
 
 :Select: By clicking on a listed section box it gets selected and automatically selected in the viewport as well.
          The same goes the other way around, when selecting a section box in the viewport it will be selected automatically in the hierarchy.

 :Enable: When ticked, the section box is enabled, else the section box gets disabled which is like it doesn't exist.

 :Hide: Toggle whether the bounding box of the section box should be visible or not. This won't affect the visibility of the sections made from the box.

 :Reload: (:ref:`Collection Section Box <From Collection>` only!) When changing the content of the collection of a Collection Section Box use this feature to include/exclude the added/removed objects from the section box.
