Section Box Outliner
********************

**Hierarchy**
 Here are all section boxes listed which are inside the current scene.
 
 :Select: By clicking on a listed section box it gets automatically selected in the viewport as well.
          The same goes the other way around, when selecting a section box in the viewport it will be selected automatically in the hierarchy.

|
 :Enable: When ticked, the section box is enabled, else the section box gets disabled which is like it doesn't exist.

| 
 :Hide: Toggle whether the bounding box of the section box should be visible or not. This won't affect the visibility of the sections made from the box.

|
 :Reload: :ref:`*Collection Section Box* <From Collection>` *only!* When changing the content of the collection of a Collection Section Box use this feature to include/exclude the added/removed objects from the section box.
