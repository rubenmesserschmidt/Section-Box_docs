Create Section Box
******************

**From Selection**
 Select all objects you want to include into the section box then choose *Section Box* under the *Object Context Menu* opened with ``RIGHT CLICK`` to instantiate it.
 The new created section box will be exactly bounding all selected objects.

 The section method will be automatically set to either *Boolean* or *Shader* if the active viewport shading mode is *Solid*, *Wireframe* or *Material Preview*, *Rendered* respectively.


**From Collection**
 Select the collection which containing objects you want to include into the section box in the *Outliner* and then choose *Section Box* under the *Object Context Menu* opened with ``RIGHT CLICK`` to instantiate it.
 This section box will be a *Collection Section Box* and will be displayed with a *Collection* icon in the :ref:`Section Box Outliner`.
 
 The instantiation works just like for a normal section box but with the method always set to *Boolean*.
 
 With *Collection Section Boxes* you get the option to *Reload* whenever you change the content of it's collection to include/exclude the added/removed objects from the section box.
