Create Section Box
******************

**From Selection**
 Select all objects you want to include into the section box then choose *Section Box* under the *Object Context Menu* opened with ``RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON`` to instantiate it.
 The new created section box will be exactly bounding all selected objects.

 The section method will be automatically set to either *Boolean* or *Shader* if the active viewport shading mode is *Solid*, *Wireframe* or *Material Preview*, *Rendered* respectively.
