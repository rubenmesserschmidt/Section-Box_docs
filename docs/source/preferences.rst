********
 
**Show Menu**
 When enabled the create section box operator will be displayed inside the *Object Context Menu*.
 Else you can only create section boxes through the :ref:`Outliner`.

|
**Lazy Load**
 When enabled the section will be updated only after committing a transform change of a section box using the *Boolean* method.
 Else it will be updated in realtime always. This is especially useful when working with higher amounts of triangles to save performance while transforming a section box.

|
**Default Color**
 This color defines the section color when creating a new section box using the *Shader* method. The color can then be changed for every individual section box afterwards.
