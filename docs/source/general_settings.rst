* **(Boolean) Material**: The material which will be applied to the faces capping the sections.
 :From Mesh: The material of the nearby faces will be used respectively, giving the most realistic result.
 :Custom Material: Choose any  material you have available inside your project!

Plane Settings
**************

Here are all settings located regarding the 6 individual planes the selected section box consists of.

**Transform**
 * **Plane Transform**: The amount of meters the plane is shifted along the direction of it's normal inside the box.
 * **Edge Transform**: The amount of meters each edge is additionally shifted along the direction of the plane.

**Cross Section**
 * **Enable**: When enabled the cross section will be generated in form of a 2D Mesh floating over the plane.
 * **Distance**: Determine how many meters away the cross section mesh will be from the center of the plane.
 * **Clear Outer**: When enabled the cross section will be also influenced by the sections of the other planes.
 * **Export**:
   **DXF**: Convert the cross section into a DXF file and save it at a location of your choice.
   **Object**: Convert the cross section into a Object which you can work with in Blender.
  :Clean Mesh: Dissolve vertices that don't hold any shape of the cross section.
  :Angle Threshold: Include only vertices that form an lower angle between their adjacent edges than this value.
